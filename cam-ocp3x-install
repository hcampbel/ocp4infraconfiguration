nstalling the Cluster Application Migration Operator on an OpenShift Container Platform 3 source cluster
You can install the Cluster Application Migration Operator manually on an OpenShift Container Platform 3 source cluster.

Prerequisites

Access to registry.redhat.io
OpenShift Container Platform 3 cluster configured to pull images from registry.redhat.io

To pull images, you must create an imagestreamsecret and copy it to each node in your cluster.

Procedure

Log in to registry.redhat.io with your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials:

$ sudo podman login registry.redhat.io
NOTE
If your system is configured for rootless Podman containers, sudo is not required for this procedure.

Download the operator.yml file:

$ sudo podman cp $(sudo podman create registry.redhat.io/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator:v1.2):/operator.yml ./
Download the controller-3.yml file:

$ sudo podman cp $(sudo podman create registry.redhat.io/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator:v1.2):/controller-3.yml ./
Log in to your OpenShift Container Platform 3 cluster.
Verify that the cluster can authenticate with registry.redhat.io:

$ oc run test --image registry.redhat.io/ubi8 --command sleep infinity
Create the Cluster Application Migration Operator CR object:

$ oc create -f operator.yml
The output resembles the following:

namespace/openshift-migration created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:deployers created
serviceaccount/migration-operator created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/migrationcontrollers.migration.openshift.io created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/migration-operator created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/migration-operator created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/migration-operator created
deployment.apps/migration-operator created
Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "./operator.yml":
rolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "system:image-builders" already exists 
Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "./operator.yml":
rolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "system:image-pullers" already exists
You can ignore Error from server (AlreadyExists) messages. They are caused by the Cluster Application Migration Operator creating resources for earlier versions of OpenShift Container Platform 3 that are provided in later releases.
Create the Migration controller CR object:

$ oc create -f controller-3.yml
Verify that the Velero and Restic Pods are running:

$ oc get pods -n openshift-migration
