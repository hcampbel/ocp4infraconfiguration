Migration prerequisites

You must have podman installed.
The source cluster must be OpenShift Container Platform 3.7, 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11.
You must upgrade the source cluster to the latest z-stream release.
You must have cluster-admin privileges on all clusters.
The source and target clusters must have unrestricted network access to the replication repository.
The cluster on which the Migration controller is installed must have unrestricted access to the other clusters.
If your application uses images from the openshift namespace, the required versions of the images must be present on the target cluster.

If the required images are not present, you must update the imagestreamtags references to use an available version that is compatible with your application. If the imagestreamtags cannot be updated, you can manually upload equivalent images to the application namespaces and update the applications to reference them.
